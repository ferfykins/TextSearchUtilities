The arrow went to the sun, pondering fruit
The moon ran to the stars, sun
killing eve slowly and fruit
pondering solace with ease
the purple dinosaur went fast
the fastest way
the bear enjoyed his honey
the grim reaked of death
numbers on the move
purple is majesty
my honey is sweet
random numbers groove
I enjoyed my coffee
the cat went meow
the dog went bark
the cow went moo
fastest brush of fate
the item is soon
groove on the move
cindy was grim
bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird bird
